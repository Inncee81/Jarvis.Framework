## Projection attribute introduced in version 2.1.0

Previous projection have three methods in base class that can be override in derived class

	public virtual string GetSlotName()
	{
	    return "default";
	}
	
	public virtual string GetCommonName()
	{
	    return this.GetType().Name;
	}
	
	public virtual string GetSignature()
	{
	    return "signature";
	}

These method are not virtual anymore, these three information should now be set with a specific attribute in all projections.

	[ProjectionInfo("Projection", Signature = "signature", Slot = "slot")]
	public class Projection : AbstractProjection ...
	...

You need to modify every projection introducing this attribute. In the attribute **you should put the value returned in the overriden function, or the default value returned from the base class**.

Default values are:
Signature: "signature"
Slot: "default"
